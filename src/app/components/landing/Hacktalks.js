          <p>
            Junction is a converging point thousands of developers, designers,
            and entrepreneurs from around the world. In 2016, Junction provided
            the biggest hackathon experience in Europe by bringing together 1300
            participants from over 70 countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hackathons are all about taking something you love, combining it
            with tech and learning something in the process. Junction brings
            together hackers, designers, the coolest partners and hardware for
            one weekend of hacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Junction is not your standard cafeteria hackathon. Junction is meant
            to be seen, to be heard, to be felt and most importantly to be
            experienced. Held annually in the cold and slushy Helsinki of late
            November, Junction is bound to be an unforgettable experience.
            Junction is the place to design and develop your ideas into actual
            projects together with like-minded hackers.
